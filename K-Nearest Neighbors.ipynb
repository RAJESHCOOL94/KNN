    "K nearest neighbors or KNN Algorithm is a simple algorithm which uses the entire dataset in its training phase. Whenever a prediction is required for an unseen data instance, it searches through the entire training dataset for k-most similar instances and the data with the most similar instance is finally returned as the prediction.\n",

    "KNN used in the variety of applications such as finance, healthcare, political science, handwriting detection, image recognition and video recognition. In Credit ratings, financial institutes will predict the credit rating of customers. In loan disbursement, banking institutes will predict whether the loan is safe or risky. In political science, classifying potential voters in two classes will vote or won’t vote. KNN algorithm based on feature similarity approach."

    "KNN is a non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm. Non-parametric means there is no assumption for underlying data distribution. In other words, the model structure determined from the dataset. This will be very helpful in practice where most of the real world datasets do not follow mathematical theoretical assumptions. Lazy algorithm means it does not need any training data points for model generation. All training data used in the testing phase. This makes training faster and testing phase slower and costlier. Costly testing phase means time and memory. In the worst case, KNN needs more time to scan all data points and scanning all data points will require more memory for storing training data."

    "In KNN, K is the number of nearest neighbors. The number of neighbors is the core deciding factor. K is generally an odd number if the number of classes is 2. When K=1, then the algorithm is known as the nearest neighbor algorithm. This is the simplest case. Suppose P1 is the point, for which label needs to predict. First, you find the one closest point to P1 and then the label of the nearest point assigned to P1."

Each object votes for their class and the class with the most votes is taken as the prediction. For finding closest similar points, you find the distance between points using distance measures such as Euclidean distance, Hamming distance, Manhattan distance and Minkowski distance.

    "Research has shown that no optimal number of neighbors suits all kind of data sets. Each dataset has it's own requirements. In the case of a small number of neighbors, the noise will have a higher influence on the result, and a large number of neighbors make it computationally expensive. Research has also shown that a small amount of neighbors are most flexible fit which will have low bias but high variance and a large number of neighbors will have a smoother decision boundary which means lower variance but higher bias."
